**A note to Will**

Hey Will! Thanks for taking a look at our project. The project isn't a working MVP at this point, we spent the first day with each team member doing discovery on a different path forward to arrive at our current MVP and strech goals. We have parts of the whole at this point but haven't combined them together.
